# Github API Test

## How to Run

1. **Set Up Environment**:

   - Rename `empty.env` to `.env` and paste your GitHub access token into it:
     ```
     GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Run the following command to install all required packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Build the App**:

   - Compile the TypeScript files to the `build/` folder:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

4. **Run the App**:

   - Execute the compiled app:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Alternatively, for development with automatic recompilation:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     (This uses `ts-node` to run the TypeScript files directly without a separate build step.)

5. **Run Tests**:

   - Execute the unit tests to verify the code:
     ```bash
     npm run test
     ```
   - To run tests and generate a coverage report:
     ```bash
     npm run test:coverage
     ```
     (This outputs a detailed report in the `coverage/` folder, including an HTML view at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.)

6. **Clean Build and Coverage Artifacts**:
   - Remove the `build/` and `coverage/` folders generated by compilation and testing:
     ```bash
     npm run clean
     ```
     (This uses `rimraf` to delete both directories, ensuring a fresh start for builds or tests.)

## What

For the coding task, we'll build a tool to analyze pull request traffic for a Github organization. For the part you do on your own: write some code that will retrieve every pull request for the Ramda organization using the Github web API and store the results in memory. When we pair, we will use this collection of pull requests for analysis of things like patterns across PRs of different statuses. For example, we might answer a question like "how many pull requests were merged week over week across the organization?‚Äù

## Requirements

- Do not use a pre-existing Github library.
- JavaScript or Typescript, ideally as a NodeJS console app
- Write some code that will retrieve every pull request for the Ramda organization using the Github web API and store the results in memory.

Do not use a pre-existing Github library. We want to see you interact directly with the Github API and use JavaScript or Typescript, ideally as a NodeJS console app. Other than that, use whatever tools (frameworks, etc) you like, structure your code however you like, etc. We care much more about how you solve technical problems generally than any specific knowledge and we want to see you at your best.

## Here are some resources:

- Ramda organization: https://github.com/ramda
- Github API docs: https://developer.github.com/v3/
- If you want, feel free to use the new GraphQL API instead of the v3 REST API: https://developer.github.com/v4/

You will receive an invitation to join a private channel in our public Slack workspace with some engineers. This is the best place to direct any questions you may have about the coding task and where you will submit the code. Because we value work/life balance, you can expect Slack responses during normal business hours (9AM ET to 5PM PT) within a few hours.

## Please complete the task by one week from today (though let us know now if you'll need more time and it's likely we can accommodate you!).

When you complete the take home task, please:

- Let us know how many pull requests your project retrieves
- Push your project to your Github account and send us a link to the repo - or if you'd rather not have it on your Github account, a link to Dropbox or an emailed zip file is fine, too
- If you use a framework that generates boilerplate code, let us know which parts of the project to focus on
- Drop the link into the slack channel that you have been invited to

Once we get a chance to review the project, we will be in touch about next steps.

Please feel free to ask questions, and good luck!
